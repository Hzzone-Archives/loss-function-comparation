#### Generate Dataset
Generate two-patchs dataset randomly and classification dataset, including CASIA-WebFace trained dataset and lfw test dataset. Detailly, all network are trained and tested on the same dataset, but for Siamese Network it is two-patchs, and for Classification Network one-patch.

**Training on CASIA-WebFace, and test on lfw.**
